d) Major receives resource, confidence, and record numbers of both Captains. Calculates the success of each Captain and sends the confidence number to the General over a secure UDP connection that needs password verification
e) First download all the files into the same folder. Type "make" in the compiler. Run executable "./Major. Then run executable ./General Then run either executable "./Captain1" or "./Captain2" in either order. If the password in the passMj.txt do not match the password in passGn.txt,  download the correct passMj.txt and type 'y' in the Major terminal to the prompt "Do you want to try resending password to general? (y/n) to resend the correct password.
f) Format is the same as the table. Every time there is a connection or transfer of data, it is printed on the Major's screen.
g) Project works up to perhaps 5 digit resource/confidence numbers. :)
h) Used code from Beej Manual and "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6659858/how-to-find-a-sockets-local-port-number-windows-c" to understand getsockname().
